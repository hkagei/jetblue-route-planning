✈️ JetBlue Route Profitability & Network Planning Analysis
A realistic, end‑to‑end airline analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Tableau

📌 Executive Summary
Using a mock dataset created for educational and portfolio purposes, this project models JetBlue route performance through a realistic, end‑to‑end analytics workflow that mirrors the responsibilities of a Route Planning Analyst. The analysis combines Python, SQL, and Tableau to evaluate financial performance, operational capacity, growth trends, and strategic opportunities across a set of representative JetBlue routes.

This repository now includes a full Tableau Story, presenting the analysis through a structured narrative: from introduction, to dashboards, to insights, to final recommendations.

🎯 Project Objectives
This project simulates the analytical responsibilities of an airline network planning analyst, including:

Evaluating route‑level profitability

Identifying seasonal and demand‑driven trends

Comparing aircraft‑level performance and efficiency

Building growth and momentum metrics

Designing dashboards for executive‑level decision‑making

Validating Python logic using SQL

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, sqlite3)

SQL (SQLite)

Tableau (interactive dashboards + multi‑page story)

VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

GitHub for version control and documentation

📊 Dataset Description
All data used in this project is a mock dataset created for educational and portfolio purposes.
It is not sourced from JetBlue or any proprietary system.

The dataset is structured to realistically approximate airline route‑month performance, including:

Aircraft type assignments

Seat configuration

Distance calculations

Cost modeling

Revenue and profit metrics

Growth and momentum indicators

The enriched dataset is exported to Tableau for visualization.

🔄 Workflow Summary
The analysis follows a structured, airline‑aligned workflow:

Section 1 — Imports & Environment Setup
Load libraries and configure the analysis environment.

Section 2 — Load & Inspect Raw Dataset
Initial exploration of route‑month performance data.

Section 3 — Data Enrichment
Add aircraft types, seat configuration, distance, and cost modeling.

Section 4 — Financial Metrics
Calculate revenue, cost, profit, and margin.

Section 5 — Growth Metrics
Compute lag metrics, MoM growth, and opportunity scores.

Section 6 — Export Enriched Dataset for Tableau
Save the final dataset as jetblue_route_profitability_master.csv.

Section 7 — Tableau Dashboards & Story
Build a multi‑page Tableau Story that presents the analysis from introduction to recommendations.

Section 8 — SQL Analysis
Replicate core Python logic using SQL queries.

Section 9 — Conclusion & Recommendations
Summarize findings and propose network planning actions.

🔍 Key Insights
Profitability varies significantly by route, with clear seasonal patterns.

Some routes show strong momentum and may warrant increased capacity.

Revenue growth and passenger growth diverge on several routes, indicating pricing opportunities.

Aircraft type plays a major role in route‑level profitability and efficiency.

Opportunity scoring highlights markets with strong upside potential.
