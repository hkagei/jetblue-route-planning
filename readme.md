# ✈️ JetBlue Route Profitability & Network Planning Analysis  
*A realistic, end‑to‑end airline analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Tableau*

## 📌 Executive Summary  
Using a mock dataset created for educational and portfolio purposes, this project models JetBlue route performance through a realistic, end‑to‑end analytics workflow that mirrors the responsibilities of a Route Planning Analyst. The analysis combines Python, SQL, and Tableau to evaluate financial performance, operational capacity, and month‑over‑month growth across a set of representative JetBlue routes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
This project simulates the analytical responsibilities of an airline network planning analyst, including:

- Evaluating route‑level profitability  
- Identifying seasonal and demand‑driven trends  
- Comparing aircraft‑level performance and efficiency  
- Building growth and momentum metrics  
- Designing dashboards for executive‑level decision‑making  
- Validating Python logic using SQL  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, sqlite3)  
- **SQL** (SQLite)  
- **Tableau** (interactive dashboards)  
- **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**  
- **GitHub** for version control and documentation

## 📊 Dataset Description  
All data used in this project is a **mock dataset** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
It is not sourced from JetBlue or any proprietary system.

The dataset is structured to realistically approximate airline route‑month performance, including:

- Aircraft type assignments  
- Seat configuration  
- Distance calculations  
- Cost modeling  
- Revenue and profit metrics  
- Growth and momentum indicators  

The enriched dataset is exported to Tableau for visualization.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary  
The analysis follows a structured, airline‑aligned workflow:

### **Section 1 — Imports & Environment Setup**  
Load libraries and configure the analysis environment.

### **Section 2 — Load & Inspect Raw Dataset**  
Initial exploration of route‑month performance data.

### **Section 3 — Data Enrichment**  
Add aircraft types, seat configuration, distance, and cost modeling.

### **Section 4 — Financial Metrics**  
Calculate revenue, cost, profit, and margin.

### **Section 5 — Growth Metrics**  
Compute lag metrics, MoM growth, and opportunity scores.

### **Section 6 — Export Enriched Dataset for Tableau**  
Save the final dataset as `jetblue_route_profitability_master.csv`.

### **Section 7 — Tableau Dashboards**  
Create route‑level and aircraft‑level dashboards for executive insights.

### **Section 8 — SQL Analysis**  
Replicate core Python logic using SQL queries.

### **Section 9 — Conclusion & Recommendations**  
Summarize findings and propose network planning actions.

## 🔍 Key Insights  
- Profitability varies significantly by route, with clear seasonal patterns.  
- Some routes show strong momentum and may warrant increased capacity.  
- Revenue growth and passenger growth diverge on several routes, indicating pricing opportunities.  
- Aircraft type plays a major role in route‑level profitability and efficiency.  
- Opportunity scoring highlights markets with strong upside potential.

## 📈 Tableau Dashboards  
This project includes two dashboard groups:

### **Route‑Level Dashboards**  
- Profitability overview  
- Growth & momentum analysis  
- Opportunity score ranking  

### **Aircraft‑Level Dashboards**  
- Total profit by aircraft type  
- Profit per seat proxy  
- Monthly profit trends  
- Route profitability by aircraft assignment

## 🗄 SQL Replication  
Core analytical steps are reproduced in SQL, including:

- Route‑level profitability  
- Month‑over‑month growth  
- Window functions (LAG)  
- Opportunity score calculations  

This validates that the workflow is consistent across analytical environments.

---

## 🧩 Conclusion  
This project demonstrates a complete airline analytics workflow, from raw data to executive‑ready dashboards. It highlights skills in:

- Data engineering  
- Financial modeling  
- Growth analytics  
- SQL translation  
- Dashboard design  
- Aviation domain knowledge  

It serves as a realistic example of the work performed by airline network planning and revenue management teams.
